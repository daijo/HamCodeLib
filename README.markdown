Varicode Library
================

A library for translating between the varicode character set and varicode.

It also implements a varicode stream parser/composer.

> Varicode is a Huffman code for use in PSK31. It supports all ASCII characters, but the characters used most frequently have shorter codes. The space between characters is indicated by a 00 sequence, a variation of Fibonacci coding. Originally created for speeding up real-time keyboard-to-keyboard exchanges over low bandwidth links, it is a very useful format to shrink text files. Varicode is freely available.
